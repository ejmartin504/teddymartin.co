How did things in this country get _so_ out of whack that a Twitter troll, a petulant billionaire without a shred of compassion, wisdom or political understanding, has risen to the most powerful position in the world? A spate of recent books have arrived over the past year that attempt various explanations, comforts, and warnings about this strange and disorienting time. A friend of mine recommended Kurt Andersen’s [Fantasyland](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/209776/fantasyland-by-kurt-andersen/9780812978902/) to me earlier this summer, and I got it from the library shortly thereafter. It's a hefty book, one that promises a sweeping history of America, to help us understand how American went "haywire." Unlike most non-fiction I’ve picked up recently, I devoured it, all ~500 pages of it, in a few short weeks.

True to its tagline (“A 500-Year History”) "Fantasyland" traces the American affair with untruth through its entire history, following the threads of fantasy through each major American epoch, showing how Americans have been uniquely susceptible to unreality, in the form of religious, magical, and otherwise irrational ideologies. While the book is perhaps _overly_ exhaustive in its cataloguing of American insanity, the cumulative effect is powerful and, ultimately, convincing. It is truly sobering to read about the range of absurd delusions that have been routinely touted by apparently “serious” Americans. And in the end, I don’t think it controversial to blame the breakdown of “consensus reality”, of any agreement on the facts or what is real, as the __fundamental__ reason Trump’s election was even remotely possible. (Andersen was apparently already working on this book when the Trump presidency became a real possibility, but our 45th president happens to be the perfect exhibit A — “to describe him is practically to summarize this book.”)

## The Will to Belief

Much of the first half of the book is focused on American religion, and American Protestantism in particular, from Puritans to Mormons. Andersen persuasively argues that much of our American insanity derives from psychological and cultural habits developed in our early history, when new Protestant communities proliferated, all with their own, often mutually exclusive, interpretations of what is _really_ going on in America. These historical explorations are surprising and enlightening. They have the most impact when they show, in an echo of today's hysterical defenders of unreality, how far the believers will go to twist facts and reason to suit their worldview.

Andersen argues that the American tendency to “go our own way,” believing in whatever we’d like without any external leadership or guidance  (a tendency we can clearly trace to today’s outrageous conspiracy theories) is, to a certain extent, inherent in Protestantism itself, with its emphasis on faith through a _personal_ knowledge of God. Especially in America, where Protestant exploration was given free reign over human behavior, this kind of personal religious belief resulted in a flourishing of idiosyncratic visions of what is real. I came away from these parts of the book with a new understanding of the various types of American religion — how diverse and, yes, strange they often are.  

## "Full Fantasyland"

Though the book spends more than half of its length on pre-1960 America, Andersen believes that the 60s broke something loose in our national psyche, mainstreaming magical thinking in an unprecedented way, leading to  what he calls “Full Fantasyland.” The 60s brought about a dangerous break with “consensus reality”; all the sudden _everyone_, not just the very religious, was encouraging people to “find their own truth.” This was not, of course, limited to religion, but became pervasive in popular culture and academia. 

For Andersen, nothing encapsulates the pernicious tendencies of this era than the Gestalt Prayer:

> I do my thing and you do your thing.
> I am not in this world to live up to your expectations,
> And you are not in this world to live up to mine.
> You are you, and I am I,
> and if by chance we find each other, it's beautiful. 
> If not, it can't be helped.

Of the prayer, Andersen writes, “in America, which _began_ on a slippery slope of subjectivity, this new creed helped accelerate the giant slalom towards a concoct-your-own-truth culture and society.” Indeed, the prayer does exemplify the thinking of the time, and its enshrining of subjectivity. Across previously “rational” institutions, in particular Universities, postmodernism began to chip away at shared notions of truth — e.g. “there are myriad perspectives on the world, each with its own legitimate claim to truth.” And what started in the 60s turned into a widespread cultural perspective, thoroughly mainstreamed by the mid-80s or so. By then, the “Establishment” had given “a big green light to treating beliefs as facts and the imaginary as actual.” There was now a “smog of subjectivity that… hung thick over the whole American mindscape” after the 60s and 70s. “The distinction between opinion and fact was crumbling on many fronts.” 

Andersen’s most trenchant point concerns how the ideas and rationales developed in the name of empowerment and self-actualization became a powerful tool of reactionary forces. He persuasively shows how the "squishy," self-affirming ideas of new-age spirituality and the academic questioning of reason opened the door for the nefarious insanity of today: “postmodern intellectuals… turned out to be useful idiots for the American right” That is, the Right was allowed to go off the rails — with its extreme vision of Christianity, its new Theocratic ideas of American governance, its denial of science — because, along with more progressive ideologies, it was allowed to pursue its own truth, unbound to rational argument or any sense of shared reality. 

It’s a good point that bears repeating: when the gates were opened, culturally, for the embrace of a multitude of perspectives, the guardrails of discourse were removed entirely, and shared truth was abandoned. What came through those gates was, at first, definitively “progressive”. But the gates remained opened, for any and every kind of noxious idea and unhinged conspiracy to seep out and into the bloodstream of American culture.

## And yet…

It is tempting to agree wholeheartedly with Andersen. We see the fruits of Fantasyland, and they are incredibly pernicious, from Donald Trump, to climate change denialism, to Alex Jones' noxious theories about Sandy Hook. And yet, I find myself unable to embrace his brand of rational bemusement at the various fantasies spun up by the American ability to imagine new realities. Indeed, I find perspective sometimes rationalistic to a fault. He seems unable or unwilling to acknowledge the veracity or viability of every non-rational practice, from basically any religious observance to alternative medicines. His point is that these practices are not open to unbiased, rational verification and thus are boundlessly susceptible to overstatement, hyperbole, and blind adherence in the face of overwhelming evidence. Fair enough. But to abandon them entirely would leave a gaping void in human experience. 

For in the end, isn’t there _something to_ all of the hokum? Perhaps plants aren’t sentient (as [“The Secret Life of Plants”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_Life_of_Plants) would have us believe), but I have a hard time signing off on the idea that there is no greater, transcendent (or at least trans-personal) world which we can access in some way, a world that is suppressed by the ruling class, by the forces of capital, which would prefer that we  look away from that which is not quantifiable or controllable. How can we ever change the world if we cannot use our imagination to picture better realities? 

I wonder if there is some way to reconcile these perspectives, to embrace imagination and fantasy while remaining grounded in a rational belief in science and facts. I am a Catholic, an unabashed believer in things unseen and rationally impossible. But I have also seen and been relieved by many prominent members of the Church (sadly not a majority) who adapted their understanding of the faith to science, to outside perspectives, other faiths, to undeniable realities about our changing world. I believe in rationality, and I am dismayed by the state of the world and the extreme gullibility in this country, but I don’t know if we would be better off without the spiritual pursuit of a better world, the belief that we can do better. We may look in horror at those who believe fantastical conspiracies, but what drives them to these beliefs in the first place? Isn't is our responsibility to present more positive and affirming fantasies? It should be noted that rationality and science are always changing and adapting to the world as well — see the recent studies about the benefits of meditation or psychedelic drugs, which were once the exclusive domain of Fantasyland. 

In a way, we are, all of us, born into Fantasyland from the day we can start to imagine things that are not true. Perhaps American society has gone way too far in the direction of imagination, but a better world will not materialize when we give up on fantasy and embrace rationality completely. Rather, it will be the result of compassionate fantasy, the kind that leads to self-sacrifice for the greater good of the human project.
