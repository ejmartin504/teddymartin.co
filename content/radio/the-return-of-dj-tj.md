> My first show back since the COVID-19 pandemic struck.
> My first pre-recorded show, ever. (It took me nearly two weeks, from my first attempts to record, to finishing this show.)
> I was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying the process of pre-recording a show: assembling all of the audio pieces into something coherent and enjoyable.
> Hope you enoy it.
